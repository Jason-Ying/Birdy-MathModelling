	\item
	The market is a competitive market where the ultimate purpose of merchants is earning profits and that of customers is getting their needs at the lowest price.

	\item
	The relationship between used \RPd\ and the equal currency at the checkout is linear.
	
	\item
	If a customer goes shopping and has its reward points, the customer will choose to use it and obtain most discount.
	
	\textsl{
	This assumption is based on the last one. Since the relationship is linear, customers don't need to take into account how to spend the reward points reasonably to obtain most discount, and nor do we.
