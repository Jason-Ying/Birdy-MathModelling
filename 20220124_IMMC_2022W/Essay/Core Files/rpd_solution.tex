From Equation \ref{eq:I_theta_relationship}\ we can know that at the balance status of the alliance, all $\epsilon$\ should be as close as possible, describing as
\[  \sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\epsilon_i-\mu)^{2}}{n} \to 0  \]
in which $\mu$ is the average $\epsilon$.

The final result shows that $\epsilon$ is actually not sensitive with $\Phi$. So the relationship turns out to be
\[  RP = c \cdot \sqrt{\theta}  \]
So the optimal distribution should simply be
\[  RP_1 : RP_2 : \ldots : RP_n = \sqrt{\theta_1} : \sqrt{\theta_2} : \ldots : \sqrt{\theta_n}  \]
