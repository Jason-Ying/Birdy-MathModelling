After going through an amount of resident and merchant areas, we can safely put forward that the distance from resident areas to the nearest merchant is within two times the radius of the coverage circle. The black lines connect each other merchant. The bolder lines are the outmost lines and they form a polygon. Since the resident area usually appears to be like rectangles, we draw lines parallel with each side outside the polygon. The parallel lines are connected to form the red line, which shows the resident area border.
