Under such a background, merchants can benefit themselves by joining in such a decentralized reward points system. Such a kind of system can be fallen into two forms: one-to-one alliance and many-to-many alliance.

We hope to build mathematical models to measure how benefits can be maximized in these two alliances. 

  \begin{itemize}  
  \item
  For the one-to-one alliance, we want to develop the factors that enable the alliance to obtain more benefits, then calculate its impact on the yearly revenue of merchants by our mathematical model.

  \item 
  For many-to-many alliances, we hope to find the suitable number of merchants in the alliances and the change of alliance pattern affected by yearly revenue and profit of each merchant.
  
  \end{itemize}  

In addition, as more and more merchants join in the many-to-many alliances, we want to give merchants different weights based on how much they contribute. To achieve this, we need to develop a mathematical model to determine the amount of reward points allocated to a particular merchant in this alliance.
