From Figure \ref{fig:sa_mtm_n}\ we can know that the optimal $n$ for each ally is not the same. And the \textsl{Model Assumption 1}\ can be described as
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{RP}{\sqrt{\theta}} + g(\Phi) \to c\ \textup{(for each ally)}
\label{eq:I_theta_relationship}
\end{equation}
in which $c$ is a constant whose value does not matter.
