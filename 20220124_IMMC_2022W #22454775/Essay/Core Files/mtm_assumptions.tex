\begin{enumerate}
\item
Every merchant has its impact on its neighboring 200 meters.

\textsl{
This is partly based on the reality --- on this condition, as the number of allies ($n$) rises, $RC$ increases and $\frac{d}{dn} RC$ decreases.
}

\item
In every given limited area, all customers are averagely distributed.

\textsl{
Under this circumstance, the relationship between $RC$\ and its impact is linear.
}

\item
All the allies in the alliance are listed companies.

\textsl{
We need to quantify the scale of every ally. We decide to measure it by the company's market value. 
}
